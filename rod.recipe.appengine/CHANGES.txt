Changes
=======

2.0.6 2014-12-31
----------------

    - use_setuptools_pkg_resources support for pkg_resources as a package
      and the setuptools zip is unpacked during installation [jjmurre] 


2.0.5 2014-12-30
----------------

    - pkg_resources has changed from a module to a package which broke
      the 'use_setuptools_pkg_resources' option. Now the package is copied if
      it is a package. [jjmurre]

2.0.4 2014-09-04
----------------

    - Added 'ignore-packages' configuration, to exclude problematic packages [jjmurre]
      
2.0.3 2013-06-17
----------------
    
    - Fix for issue 18/20/21: appcfg should not use the 'appserver-run-file' config. variable.
    
2.0.2 2013-06-18
----------------

    - Added 'appserver-script-name' configuration, to accomodate alternative
      appserver scripts names (some versions in the 1.7.x range used
      dev_appserver2.py). [jjmurre]

    - Added 'appserver-run-file' configurations, because Google changed this
      name somewhere in the 1.7.x version range. [jjmurre]

    - Added 'symlink-gae-runtime'. Throught this switch a symlink to
      the GAE runtime script '_python_runtime.py' can be made in de 
      buildout bin directory. This symlink is needed, because the
      developments server had been thouroughly rewritten by Google. [jjmurre]
